## Data Wrangling <a name="datawrangling"></a>

Dataset url : [full_data.zip](https://github.com/vaibhavmaurya/BusAndTicketsOptimization/blob/master/data/full_data.zip)

This archived file contains a text file named `aug18-dec18.txt`.

This dataset is paginated and contains unnecessary strings as follows.

#### Challenges in the dataset
This dataset has following issues:

- Dataset is in a flat text file. It is paginated, 21 rows per page, though all pages are in the same text file seperated by new line.
- Columns in the dataset are not fully qualified names. Each column is seperated by space.
- Size of a column is difficult to determine.
- The text files contains some additional strings in the begining and in the end also.

Fortunately this dataset has following pros.

- Dataset columns positions are fixed throughout the dataset.
- Each page is uniformly seperated by newline throughout the dataset.

### Gathering Data <a name="gatherdata"></a>

To parse dataset into csv, following is the strategy opted:

- Created a [json file](https://github.com/vaibhavmaurya/BusAndTicketsOptimization/blob/master/src/datastructure.json) to parse text dataset. This json file contains column name as key and value is the object which contains start of the column, size of the column and position of the column.
- Created a [library](https://github.com/vaibhavmaurya/BusAndTicketsOptimization/blob/master/src/DataProcessingModule.py) to clean the dataset.

The program follows the logic as below.

Data is gathered in the [notebook](https://github.com/vaibhavmaurya/BusAndTicketsOptimization/blob/master/notebooks/Data_Wrangling.ipynb).
